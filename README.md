# Power Me Up

## Workout Tracker Application

For my personal project, I am planning an application that tracks workouts, specifically one that can be categorized
into powerlifting movements

- Push: Bench
- Pull: Dead lift
- Legs: Squat

This application will track the workouts in
a collection and can be managed by the user. The user can favourite certain workouts, sort them
based on duration, favourites, date added, and much more. The application will also take in the personal info of the
user and can be updated to match the current stats of the user. This app will be used by people who are working out,
using the weight room, or mainly for powerlifters who want to keep track of their workouts. This project is of interest
to me as during the past year, I have been getting into weight lifting but primarily powerlifting. I take interest of
powerlifting competitions and testing my limits in terms of my strength. I often find myself wishing that I kept track
of the lifts that I performed or the workouts that I found to be special and with this app, I am really interested in
seeing how managing and tracking something works.

## Phase 4: Task 3
My profile class should have been associated with by Workouts class. That class is completely
independent of Workouts and workout, and it makes no sense to have a class by itself that is only
associated with the GUI. It makes much more sense if Workouts should have a profile, and a list of
workouts under that certain profile.
- I would change the class Workouts so that it has a profile in it
- My UML class design would make much more sense in that Workouts would have one Profile associated to it
